# Exercise 1: plotting a histogram and using NumPy's utility functions
The file `reaction_times.txt` contains a list of 400 reaction times. Your task is to:
1. Determine the mean and standard deviation of the reaction times. Print this to the screen and save it to a file named `descriptive_statistics.txt`. Ensure you round the result to 2 decimal places.
2. Plot a histogram with 30 bins to visualise the reaction times. Save the graph as `histogram.png`.
